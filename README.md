# F1-Championship-Data-Pipeline-2021

F1 Championship Data Pipeline (2021) is an automated data extraction and reporting workflow built using n8n.
It fetches the 2021 Formula 1 Drivers' Championship standings from an API, filters only top-performing drivers (points >150), stores the results into Google Sheets, converts them into an Excel file, and emails the final report automatically.
This workflow provides a fast, clean, and automated way to generate F1 stats reports.
